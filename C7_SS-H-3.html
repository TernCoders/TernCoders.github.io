    <h2>Delhi Sultans</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Under the Tomaras and Chauhans, Delhi became an important commercial
        centre.
      </li>
      <li>
        Many rich Jaina merchants lived in the city and constructed several
        temples.
      </li>
      <li>
        Coins called <span>dehliwal</span> were minted in Delhi and had a wide
        circulation.
      </li>
      <li>
        The transformation of Delhi into a capital controlling vast areas began
        with the foundation of the <span>Delhi Sultanate</span> in the early
        13th century.
      </li>
      <li>
        The Delhi Sultans built many cities in the area now known as Delhi.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Rulers of Delhi</h3>
    <img src="rulers-of-delhi.jpeg" alt="" />
    <h2>Finding Out about the Delhi Sultans</h2>
    <p>
      Tarikh (singular)/tawarikh (plural) are valuable histories, written in
      Persian, the language of administration under the Delhi Sultans that
      provide a lot of information. It was written by learned men- secretaries,
      administrators, poets and courtiers, who both recounted events and advised
      rulers on governance, emphasising the importance of the just rule.
      Following ideas to keep in mind:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        the authors of tawarikh lived in cities (mainly Delhi) and hardly ever
        in villages.
      </li>
      <li>
        They often wrote their histories for Sultans in the hope of rich
        rewards.
      </li>
      <li>
        These authors advised rulers on the need to preserve an “ideal” social
        order based on birth right and gender distinctions.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <ul>
      <li>Not everybody followed these ideas.</li>
      <li>
        In 1236-Sultan Iltutmish’s daughter, Raziyya became Sultan-chronicler of
        the age, Minhaj-i Siraj, stated she was more able and qualified than all
        her brothers-He was not comfortable at having a queen as ruler- Nobles
        not happy at her attempts to rule independently. 1240-She was removed
        from the throne.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>The Expansion of the Delhi Sultanate</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <span>Delhi's authority</span> was challenged by
        <span>Mongol invasions</span> from Afghanistan.
      </li>
      <li>
        The <span>Sultanate consolidation</span> occurred during the reign of
        <span>Ghiyasuddin Balban</span> and expanded further under
        <span>Alauddin Khalji</span> and <span>Muhammad Tughluq</span>.
      </li>
      <li>
        The first campaigns along the “<span>internal frontier</span>” of the
        Sultanate aimed at consolidating the <span>hinterlands</span> of
        garrison towns.
      </li>
      <li>
        The second expansion occurred along the “<span>external frontier</span>”
        of the Sultanate.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>
      A Closer Look: Administration and Consolidation under the Khaljis and
      Tughluqs
    </h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Consolidation of a kingdom (as vast as the Delhi Sultanate) requires
        reliable governors and administrators. Early Delhi Sultans, especially
        Iltutmish did not appoint aristocrats and landed chieftains as
        governors. They favoured their special slaves purchased for military
        service(called bandagan in Persian). The Khaljis and Tughluqs continued
        to use bandagan and also raised people of humble birth, who were often
        their clients, to high political positions and appointed them as
        generals and governors leading to political instability. Slaves and
        clients were loyal to their masters and patrons, but not to heirs. The
        accession of a new monarch often saw conflict between the old and the
        new nobility. Patronage of these humble people by the Delhi Sultans
        shocked many elites and the authors of Persian tawarikh criticised the
        Delhi Sultans for appointing the “low and base-born” to high offices.
      </li>
      <li>
        The Khalji and Tughluq monarchs appointed military commanders as
        governors of territories of varying sizes (called iqta) and their holder
        was called iqtadar or muqti- duty of the muqtis to lead military
        campaigns and maintain law and order in their iqtas-In exchange for
        their military services, the muqtis collected the revenues of their
        assignments as salary-paid their soldiers from this revenues-to make the
        control over muqtis most effective their office was not inheritable-they
        were assigned iqtas for a short period of time before being
        shifted-appointed accountant checked the amount of revenue collected by
        the muqtis-As the Delhi Sultans brought the hinterland of the cities
        under their control, they forced the landed chieftains – the Samanta
        aristocrats and rich landlords to accept their authority-Under Alauddin
        Khalji, the state brought the assessment and collection of land revenue
        under its own control- rights of the local chieftains to levy taxes
        cancelled and were also forced to pay taxes-Some of the old chieftains
        and landlords serve the Sultanate as revenue collectors and assessors.
      </li>
      <li>
        There were three types of taxes: (1) on cultivation called kharaj and
        amounting to about 50% of the peasant’s produce, (2) on cattle and (3)
        on houses-Large parts of the subcontinent remained outside the control
        of the Delhi Sultans-was difficult to control distant provinces like
        Bengal from Delhi-after annexing southern India, the entire region
        became independent- In the Gangetic plain, there were forested areas
        that Sultanate forces could not penetrate- Local chieftains established
        their rule in these regions-Rulers like Alauddin Khalji and Muhammad
        Tughluq could force their control for a short duration in these areas.
      </li>
      <li>
        1219- Mongols under Genghis Khan invaded Transoxiana in north-east
        Iran-Delhi Sultanate faced their onslaught soon after-Mongol attacks on
        the Delhi Sultanate increased during the reign of Alauddin Khalji and in
        the early years of Muhammad Tughluq’s rule-forced the two rulers to
        mobilise a large standing army in Delhi which posed a huge
        administrative challenge.
      </li>
      <p>
        <span
          >See, below how both the sultans dealt with these administrative
          challenges:

    <h2>The Sultanate in the Fifteenth and Sixteenth Centuries</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        After the <span>Tughluqs</span>, the <span>Sayyid</span> and
        <span>Lodi</span> dynasties ruled from <span>Delhi</span> and
        <span>Agra</span> until 1526.
      </li>
      <li>
        By this time, <span>Jaunpur</span>, <span>Bengal</span>,
        <span>Malwa</span>, <span>Gujarat</span>, <span>Rajasthan</span> and
        <span>South India</span> had independent rulers with flourishing states.
      </li>
      <li>
        This period saw the rise of new ruling groups like the
        <span>Afghans</span> and the <span>Rajputs</span>.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>Sher Shah Sur</span> (1540-1545) began as a manager of a small
        territory in <span>Bihar</span> and eventually challenged and defeated
        the <span>Mughal emperor Humayun</span> (1530-1540, 1555-1556).
