    <h2>The Cheras and the Development of Malayalam</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        One example of the connection between
        <span>language and region</span> is the Chera kingdom of Mahodayapuram.
      </li>
      <li>
        Established in the <span>9th century</span> in the south-western part of
        the peninsula, part of present-day <span>Kerala</span>.
      </li>
      <li>
        It is likely that <span>Malayalam</span> was spoken in this region.
      </li>
      <li>
        The rulers introduced the <span>Malayalam language and script</span> in
        their inscriptions.
      </li>
      <li>
        This marks one of the
        <span>earliest uses of a regional language</span> in official records in
        the Indian subcontinent.
      </li>
      <li>The Cheras also drew upon <span>Sanskritic traditions</span>.</li>
      <li>
        The <span>temple theatre of Kerala</span>, which emerged during this
        time, borrowed stories from the Sanskrit epics.
      </li>
      <li>
        The <span>first literary works in Malayalam</span>, dated to about the
        12th century, were directly indebted to Sanskrit.
      </li>
      <li>
        A 14th-century text, the <span>Lilatilakam</span>, dealt with grammar
        and poetics.
      </li>
      <li>
        The Lilatilakam was composed in <span>Manipravalam</span> – literally
        meaning “<span>diamonds and corals</span>”, referring to the two
        languages: Sanskrit and the regional language.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Rulers and Religious Traditions: The Jagannatha Cult</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        In various regions, <span>regional cultures</span> developed around
        religious traditions.
      </li>
      <li>
        The best example is the <span>cult of Jagannatha</span> (meaning "lord
        of the world", a name for Vishnu) at <span>Puri, Orissa</span>.
      </li>
      <li>
        To this day, local <span>tribal people</span> make the wooden image of
        the deity.
      </li>
      <li>
        This suggests that the deity was originally a
        <span>local god</span> later identified with <span>Vishnu</span>.
      </li>
      <li>
        In the <span>12th century</span>, Ganga dynasty ruler
        <span>Anantavarman</span> decided to build a temple for
        <span>Purushottama Jagannatha</span> at Puri.
      </li>
      <li>
        In <span>1230</span>, King <span>Anangabhima III</span> dedicated his
        kingdom to the deity and declared himself the “<span>deputy</span>” of
        the god.
      </li>
      <li>The temple became an important <span>pilgrimage centre</span>.</li>
      <li>
        Its <span>social and political authority</span> also increased over
        time.
      </li>
      <li>
        Those who conquered Orissa – the <span>Mughals</span>, the
        <span>Marathas</span>, and the <span>English East India Company</span> –
        tried to control the temple to make their rule acceptable to local
        people.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>The Rajputs and Traditions of Heroism</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        In the <span>19th century</span>, the British called a region
        constituting most of present-day <span>Rajasthan</span> as
        <span>Rajputana</span>.
      </li>
      <li>
        This name was based on the belief that the area was inhabited only or
        mainly by <span>Rajputs</span> (which was only partially true).
      </li>
      <li>
        Several groups across <span>northern and central India</span> identify
        themselves as Rajputs.
      </li>
      <li>Many people other than Rajputs also live in Rajasthan.</li>
      <li>
        Rajputs have significantly contributed to the
        <span>distinctive culture of Rajasthan</span>.
      </li>
      <li>
        These cultural traditions were closely linked with the
        <span>ideals and aspirations of the rulers</span>.
      </li>
      <li>
        From the <span>8th century</span>, most of present-day Rajasthan was
        ruled by various <span>Rajput families</span>.
      </li>
      <li><span>Prithviraj</span> was one such famous Rajput ruler.</li>
      <li>
        They upheld the ideal of the <span>hero</span> who fought bravely and
        chose death in battle rather than accept defeat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stories of Rajput heroes were recorded in <span>poems and songs</span>.
      </li>
      <li>
        These stories were recited by
        <span>specially trained minstrels</span> to preserve heroic memories and
        inspire others.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>Ordinary people</span> were drawn to these tales for their
        <span>dramatic situations</span> and strong emotions—<span
          >loyalty, friendship, love, valour, anger</span
        >, etc.
      </li>
      <li>
        Women often featured as the “<span>cause</span>” of conflicts, with men
        fighting to either “<span>win</span>” or “<span>protect</span>” them.
      </li>
      <li>
        Women are also depicted as
        <span>following their heroic husbands</span> in life and death.
      </li>
      <li>
        There are stories about the practice of <span>Sati</span>—the immolation
        of widows on the funeral pyres of their husbands.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Beyond Regional Frontiers: The Story of Kathak</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <span>Dance</span> is found in various forms across different regions of
        India.
      </li>
      <li>
        One significant example is the history of <span>Kathak</span>,
        associated with several parts of <span>North India</span>.
      </li>
      <li>
        The term <span>kathak</span> is derived from <span>katha</span>, a
        Sanskrit word meaning “story”.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>Kathaks</span> were originally a caste of storytellers in North
        Indian temples, using <span>gestures and songs</span> to enhance their
        performances.
      </li>
      <li>
        Kathak evolved into a distinct dance form in the
        <span>15th and 16th centuries</span> with the spread of the
        <span>bhakti movement</span>.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>Legends of Radha and Krishna</span> were enacted in folk plays
        called <span>rasa lila</span>, combining folk dance with Kathak-style
        storytelling gestures.
      </li>
      <li>
        Under the <span>Mughal emperors</span> and their nobles, Kathak was
        performed in royal courts.
      </li>
      <li>
        It acquired new features and developed into a distinctive style of
        classical dance.
      </li>
      <li>
        Kathak developed in two main <span>gharanas</span> (traditions): one in
        <span>Jaipur</span> (Rajasthan) and the other in <span>Lucknow</span>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Under the patronage of <span>Wajid Ali Shah</span>, the last Nawab of
        Awadh, it grew into a major art form.
      </li>
      <li>
        By the third quarter of the <span>19th century</span>, it was well
        established in regions like
        <span
          >Punjab, Haryana, Jammu and Kashmir, Bihar, and Madhya Pradesh</span
        >.
      </li>
      <li>
        Kathak emphasized <span>intricate footwork</span>,
        <span>elaborate costumes</span>, and the
        <span>enactment of stories</span>.
      </li>
      <li>
        During the <span>British period</span>, Kathak, like many cultural
        practices, was viewed with <span>disfavour</span> by administrators.
      </li>
      <li>
        Despite this, it <span>survived</span> through performances by
        courtesans.
      </li>
      <li>
        After <span>Independence</span>, Kathak was officially recognised as one
        of the six “<span>classical</span>” dance forms of India.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <span>Dance</span> is found in various forms across different regions of

        of the six “<span>classical</span>” dance forms of India.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Painting for Patrons: The Tradition of Miniatures</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Another cultural tradition that developed was that of
        <span>miniature painting</span>.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>Miniatures</span> are small-sized paintings made using
        <span>watercolour on cloth or paper</span>.
      </li>
      <li>
        The <span>earliest miniatures</span> were created on
        <span>palm leaves or wood</span> in western India and were used to
        illustrate <span>Jaina texts</span>.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>Mughal emperors</span> Akbar, Jahangir, and Shah Jahan patronised
        highly skilled painters.
      </li>
      <li>
        These painters primarily illustrated <span>manuscripts</span> with
        historical accounts and poetry.
      </li>
      <li>
        The paintings used <span>brilliant colours</span> and portrayed
        <span>court scenes</span>, <span>battles</span>,
        <span>hunting scenes</span>, and social life.
      </li>
      <li>
        They were often <span>exchanged as gifts</span> and viewed only by an
        <span>exclusive audience</span> such as the emperor and his close
        circle.
      </li>
      <li>
        With the <span>decline of the Mughal Empire</span>, many artists
        migrated to <span>regional courts</span>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mughal artistic styles influenced <span>Deccan</span> and
        <span>Rajput courts</span> of Rajasthan while retaining local
        characteristics.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>Portraits of rulers</span>, court scenes, and themes from
        <span>mythology and poetry</span> became popular.
      </li>
      <li>
        Important centres of miniature painting included
        <span>Mewar, Jodhpur, Bundi, Kota</span>, and <span>Kishangarh</span>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Another prominent region was the <span>Himalayan foothills</span>, now
        part of <span>Himachal Pradesh</span>.
      </li>
      <li>
        By the <span>late 17th century</span>, a bold and intense style called
        <span>Basohli</span> emerged there.
      </li>
      <li>
        A popular text for illustration was
        <span>Bhanudatta’s Rasamanjari</span>.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>Nadir Shah’s invasion</span> and the
        <span>1739 conquest of Delhi</span> led to the migration of Mughal
        artists to the hills.
      </li>
      <li>
        These artists found new <span>patrons</span> and helped found the
        <span>Kangra school of painting</span>.
      </li>
      <li>
        By the <span>mid-18th century</span>, Kangra artists had developed a new
        style inspired by <span>Vaishnavite traditions</span>.
      </li>
      <li>
        This style used <span>soft colours</span> like blues and greens and gave
        a <span>lyrical treatment</span> to themes.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>Ordinary people</span> also created artwork on
        <span>pots, walls, floors, and cloth</span>.
      </li>
      <li>
        While most of these folk artworks did not survive,
        <span>miniatures were carefully preserved</span> in palaces for
        centuries.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>A Closer Look: Bengal</h2>
    <h3>The Growth of a Regional Language</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Regions are often identified by the <span>language spoken</span> by
        their people.
      </li>
      <li>
        It is commonly assumed that people in <span>Bengal</span> always spoke
        <span>Bengali</span>, though this is historically not accurate.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>Bengali</span> is now recognised as a
        <span>language derived from Sanskrit</span>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Early Sanskrit texts from the
        <span>mid-first millennium BCE</span> suggest the people of Bengal did
        not originally speak Sanskritic languages.
      </li>
      <li>
        From the <span>4th–3rd centuries BCE</span>,
        <span>commercial ties</span> between Bengal and
        <span>Magadha (South Bihar)</span> led to cultural growth.
      </li>
      <li>
        In the <span>4th century</span>, <span>Gupta rulers</span> established
        political control over <span>north Bengal</span> and settled
        <span>Brahmanas</span> in the region.
      </li>
      <li>
        This increased <span>linguistic and cultural influence</span> from the
        <span>mid-Ganga valley</span>.
      </li>
      <li>
        In the <span>7th century</span>, the Chinese traveller
        <span>Xuan Zang</span> observed Sanskrit-related languages in use across
        Bengal.
      </li>
      <li>
        From the <span>8th century</span>, Bengal became a regional power under
        the <span>Pala dynasty</span>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Between the <span>14th and 16th centuries</span>, Bengal was ruled by
        <span>Sultans</span> independent of Delhi.
      </li>
      <li>
        In <span>1586</span>, <span>Akbar conquered Bengal</span> and formed the
        Bengal <span>suba</span> (province).
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>Persian</span> became the <span>language of administration</span>,
        but <span>Bengali</span> developed as a regional language.
      </li>
      <li>
        By the <span>15th century</span>, different
        <span>Bengali dialects</span> were united under a common
        <span>literary language</span> based on the spoken language of
        <span>West Bengal</span>.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>Bengali</span> evolved through several stages and includes
        <span>non-Sanskrit words</span> from
        <span>tribal languages, Persian, and European sources</span>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Early Bengali literature is divided into two main categories:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Texts <span>indebted to Sanskrit</span>, including:
            <ul>
              <li><span>Translations</span> of Sanskrit epics</li>
              <li>
                <span>Mangalakavyas</span> (auspicious poems on local deities)
              </li>
              <li>
                <span>Bhakti literature</span>, such as biographies of
                <span>Chaitanyadeva</span>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Texts <span>independent of Sanskrit</span>, including:
            <ul>

        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Texts from the first category are easier to date (late 15th to mid-18th
        century) due to the discovery of manuscripts.
      </li>
      <li>
        Texts in the second category were transmitted <span>orally</span>, are
        harder to date, and were especially popular in
        <span>eastern Bengal</span>, where Brahmanical influence was weaker.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Pirs and Temples</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        In the <span>16th century</span>, large-scale
        <span>migration</span> took place from <span>western Bengal</span> to
        the <span>forested and marshy areas</span> of
        <span>south-eastern Bengal</span>.
      </li>
      <li>
        People moved <span>eastwards</span>, cleared forests, and brought land
        under <span>rice cultivation</span>.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>Local communities</span> such as fisherfolk and shifting
        cultivators, often tribals, merged with the new peasant communities.
      </li>
      <li>
        This migration coincided with the establishment of
        <span>Mughal control</span> over Bengal, with their
        <span>capital at Dhaka</span>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mughal <span>officials and functionaries</span> received land grants and
        built <span>mosques</span>, which served as centres for religious
        transformation.
      </li>
      <li>
        Early settlers, in search of <span>order and assurance</span> in new
        settlements, found guidance in <span>community leaders</span>.
      </li>
      <li>
        These leaders acted as <span>teachers and adjudicators</span> and were
        believed to possess <span>supernatural powers</span>.
      </li>
      <li>
        They were affectionately and respectfully referred to as
        <span>pirs</span>.
      </li>
      <li>
        The term <span>pir</span> included saints, Sufis, religious figures,
        daring colonisers, deified soldiers, Hindu and Buddhist deities, and
        even animistic spirits.
      </li>
      <li>
        The <span>cult of pirs</span> became very popular, and their
        <span>shrines</span> were found all over Bengal.
      </li>
      <li>
        From the <span>late 15th century to the 19th century</span>, Bengal
        experienced a <span>temple-building spree</span>.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>Temples</span> and religious structures were built by
        <span>emerging powerful individuals or groups</span> to show both
        <span>power and piety</span>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Many modest <span>brick and terracotta temples</span> were built with
        the support of “<span>low” social groups</span> like the
        <span>Kolu</span> (oil pressers) and <span>Kansari</span> (bell metal
        workers).
      </li>
      <li>
        The arrival of <span>European trading companies</span> opened new
        <span>economic opportunities</span> for these groups.
      </li>
      <li>
        As their <span>social and economic positions</span> improved, they built
        temples to <span>proclaim their status</span>.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>Local deities</span>, once worshipped in thatched village huts,
        gained recognition from the <span>Brahmanas</span>.
      </li>
      <li>Their <span>images</span> began to be placed in temples.</li>
      <li>
        Temples started copying the <span>dochala</span> (double-roofed) and
        <span>chauchala</span> (four-roofed) thatched hut styles.
      </li>
      <li>
        This led to the <span>evolution of the Bengali style</span> of temple
        architecture.
      </li>
      <li>
        Architectural style: four triangular roofs placed on four walls
        converging on a <span>curved line or point</span>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Temples were built on a <span>square platform</span>, with a relatively
        plain <span>interior</span>.
      </li>
      <li>
        The <span>outer walls</span> were decorated with
        <span>paintings, ornamental tiles, or terracotta tablets</span>.
      </li>
      <li>
        In <span>Vishnupur</span> in the
        <span>Bankura district of West Bengal</span>, these
        <span>decorations reached high excellence</span>.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Fish As Food</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <span>Traditional food habits</span> are generally based on
        <span>locally available food items</span>.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>Bengal</span>, being a <span>riverine plain</span>, produces
        plenty of <span>rice and fish</span>.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>Rice and fish</span> are staples and feature prominently even in
        the diets of <span>poor Bengalis</span>.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>Fishing</span> has always been an
        <span>important occupation</span> in Bengal.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>Bengali literature</span> contains many references to the
        importance of fish.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>Terracotta plaques</span> on the walls of temples and
        <span>viharas</span> (Buddhist monasteries) show scenes of
        <span>fish being dressed and sold</span> in baskets.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>Brahmanas</span> were traditionally <span>not allowed</span> to
        eat non-vegetarian food.
      </li>
      <li>
        Due to the <span>popularity of fish</span> in the local diet,
        <span>Brahmanical authorities relaxed the rules</span> for Bengal
        Brahmanas.
      </li>
      <li>
        The <span>Brihaddharma Purana</span>, a
        <span>13th-century Sanskrit text</span> from Bengal,
        <span>permitted Brahmanas</span> to eat certain varieties of fish.
      </li>
    </ul>
