    <p>
      In today’s world, <span>water shortage</span> is a
      <span>significant issue</span>. The <span>rich people</span> get access to
      <span>municipal water</span> regularly, and the
      <span>water tankers</span> are <span>affordable</span> and
      <span>accessible</span> to them. Many
      <span>middle-class people</span> have their own <span>bore wells</span>.
      Borewell water is <span>not suitable for consumption</span>, so they use
      <span>water filters</span>. Once a week they get <span>tankers</span>.
      They don’t have <span>regular access</span> to municipal water. The
      <span>poor</span> neither have <span>access</span> nor can
      <span>afford</span> regular and <span>clean water supply</span>.
    </p>
    <h2>Water as a part of the fundamental right to life:</h2>
    <h3>Why is water an essential political concern?</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Daily needs</li>
      <li>availability of Safe and clean water</li>
      <li>
        Good health- water-based diseases like diarrhea, dysentery, cholera are
        getting common in India.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>
      India's constitutional laws for satisfying the above essentials for every
      citizen of India:
    </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The Constitution of India recognizes water's right as a part of the
        Right to Life under Article 21 - establishes universal access. Ensure
        all people of the country irrespective of economic status to access
        water at an affordable cost to satisfy their daily needs. Both the high
        court and Supreme Court consider the right to water as a fundamental
        right to life.
      </li>
      <li>
        In 2007, the Andhra Pradesh High Court held a case based on a letter
        written by a Mahabubnagar district's villager. The villager brought to
        light the contamination of drinking water in that letter. The villager
        complained that a textile company was discharging poisonous chemicals
        into the stream in his village. As a result, the groundwater was getting
        contaminated, which was the source of irrigation and drinking water.
        Thus, affecting the overall livelihood of the villagers. The judges lead
        the Mahbubnagar district collector to supply at least 25 liters of water
        to every individual in the village.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Public Facilities:</h2>
    <h3>What are the public facilities?</h3>
    <p>
      Other than water, the public would need healthcare, sanitation,
      electricity, public transport, schools, and colleges. These are called
      public facilities.
    </p>
    <h3>Why is that the establishment of public facilities important?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>A community can share it.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><span>For Example:</span></p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <span>School</span> - establishments of government schools can make
        education accessible for the children in our community.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>Electricity</span> - establishing an electric power supply may
        facilitate the following:
      </li>
    </ol>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Farmers can use more electricity-powered machines like a motor pump to
        irrigate their fields.
      </li>
      <li>
        Students can get access to education through the internet only if
        electricity is accessible
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>The Government's role:</h2>
    <p>
      The Indian government is responsible for making public facilities
      available to all its citizens
    </p>
    <h3>Why is the government responsible?</h3>
    <p>
      If <span>privatized</span>, all the
      <span>private organizations and companies</span> only work for
      <span>profit</span>, and no company would be interested in
      <span>investing in the public's sanitation</span> or conducting
      <span>free campaigns</span>. Although the <span>supply of water</span>,
      <span>education</span> can be a place of interest for the private
      companies, which are already established in <span>cities</span>,
      consequence, they are <span>not affordable for the needy</span>.
    </p>
    <h3>How does the government afford it?</h3>
    <p>
      The government plans the <span>yearly budget</span> in the
      <span>parliament meeting</span>. The
      <span>taxes collected from the citizens</span> are the income of the
      government. To supply water, the government has to
      <span>invest money</span> to <span>extract and transport water</span>. The
      government charges the citizens a
      <span>small percentage of their income</span> as tax. Taxes are
      <span>not liable for poor people</span>. This money is used to enable
      everyone to get access to a <span>regular and clean water supply</span>.
    </p>
    <h3>Is water supply available to all?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        There is a significant shortage of providing public facilities to
        everyone.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>Shortage</span> - Municipality satisfies approximately only half
        the water needs of the area.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>Unequal access</span> - Area nearer to the water storage points
        have better access to water than the farther ones.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>Poverty</span> - The poor are the ones who are the most affected.
        Whereas the middle class manages by digging bore wells, buying water
        from tankers, and using bottled water for drinking.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>Availability of safe water</span> - only a few can afford to have
        access to safe and clean water.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>Taking water from farmers</span> - The private companies, to
        satisfy the increasing water takes water from agricultural lands. Mostly
        from the villages nearby to metropolitan cities. The farmers are paid
        every month authorizing the company to exploit the water from their
        land. The problem is when private companies extract water from about
        13,000 water tanks draining the water in that area. This doesn't only
        affect the farmers but the villagers altogether. As a result,
        Groundwater levels have dropped drastically
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>In Search of Alternatives:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Shortage of water during summers is common among most cities of India.
      </li>
      <li>
        The private companies have taken over the water supply chains as the
        municipality fails to meet the needs.
      </li>
      <li>
        According to the urban water commission, in cities, 135 liters (about 7
        buckets) of water is consumed per person. In slums, the supply should be
        about 20 liters (one bucket) per person. At an equivalent time, hotels
        may consume about 1600 liters (about 80 buckets) per day.
      </li>
      <li>
        A shortage of municipal water is usually considered a sign of failure of
        the government.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>
      Throughout the planet water supply is done by the government. Very rarely
      taken over by private.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <span>For Example</span>: Porto Alegre, Brazil - The city water department
      has achieved universal water access.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The average price of water is low, and the poor are charged at half the
        basic rate.
      </li>
      <li>
        The profit of the government is completely used for water supplies
      </li>
      <li>
        The people get to have a say in the upcoming schemes and water projects.
      </li>
      <li>
        The government is completely transparent about the steps taken by the
        water department.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      There was a steep rise in the water rates when handed over to private
      companies. This has made it unaffordable for many.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span>For Example</span>: In Bolivia, protests and riots broke when
      private companies were handed over the responsibility to supply water
      demanding the government to take over again.
