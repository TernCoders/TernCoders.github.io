      <h2>See The Chapter PDF</h2>
    </a>
    <h2>The Company Becomes the Diwan</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <span>12 August 1765</span>: The Mughal emperor appointed the East India
        Company as the Diwan of Bengal.
      </li>
      <li>
        As Diwan, the Company became the chief financial administrator of the
        territory under its control.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Revenue for the Company</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The company made efforts to increase the revenue and buy fine cotton and
        silk cloth as cheaply as possible.
      </li>
      <li>
        Within five years the value of goods bought by the Company in Bengal
        doubled.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      → Now the revenue collected in Bengal could finance the purchase of goods
      for export.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Bengal economy was facing a deep crisis because artisans were deserting
        villages since they were being forced to sell their goods to the Company
        at low prices.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>→ Agricultural cultivation showed signs of collapse.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        In <span>1770</span>, a terrible famine killed ten million people in
        Bengal.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The Need to Improve Agriculture</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Most Company officials felt that investment in land had to be encouraged
        and agriculture had to be improved.
      </li>
      <li>
        In <span>1793</span>, the Company introduced the Permanent Settlement.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      → By the terms of the settlement, the rajas and taluqdars were recognised
      as zamindars.
    </p>
    <p>
      → They were asked to collect rent from the peasants and pay revenue to the
      Company which was fixed permanently.
    </p>
    <p>
      → This would ensure a regular flow of revenue to the Company and encourage
      zamindars to invest in improving the land.
    </p>

    <h2>The Problem</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The zamindars were not investing in improving the quality of land.
      </li>
      <li>The revenue fixed was too high for the zamindars.</li>
      <li>Zamindars were interested in profit, not improving land.</li>
      <li>The cultivator found the system extremely oppressive.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>A New System is Devised</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        By the early nineteenth century, officials felt the revenue system
        needed change again.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Mahalwari Settlement</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Collectors went village to village estimating the revenue each village
        (mahal) had to pay.
      </li>
      <li>
        Village headman, not zamindars, was responsible for collecting and
        paying the revenue.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>→ This system was known as the Mahalwari Settlement.</p>

    <h2>The Munro System</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Known as the ryotwar or ryotwari system.</li>
      <li>Initially tried on small scale by Captain Alexander Read.</li>
      <li>
        Later developed by Thomas Munro and extended all over South India.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Ryotwari System and Its Problems</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>The settlement was made directly with the cultivators (ryots).</li>
      <li>The British acted as paternal figures protecting the ryots.</li>
      <li>Revenue officials fixed too high a demand.</li>
      <li>Peasants couldn’t pay, fled, and villages were deserted.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Crops for Europe</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        British forced/encouraged cultivators to produce commercial crops:
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>→ Jute in Bengal</p>
    <p>→ Tea in Assam</p>
    <p>→ Sugarcane in the United Provinces (now Uttar Pradesh)</p>
    <p>→ Wheat in Punjab</p>
    <p>→ Cotton in Maharashtra and Punjab</p>
    <p>→ Rice in Madras</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Various methods were used to increase crop cultivation.</li>
      <li>Indigo had great worldwide demand.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Why the Demand for Indian Indigo?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        By <span>13th century</span>, Indian indigo was used by cloth
        manufacturers in Italy, France, and Britain.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>→ Indigo was expensive but preferred for its bright color.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>European manufacturers used woad, but it gave pale dyes.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>→ Indigo was preferred for its brightness.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        French, Portuguese, English, and Spanish began indigo cultivation in
        colonies.
      </li>
      <li>
        Between <span>1783</span> and <span>1789</span>, world indigo production
        halved.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>→ British cloth dyers turned to India for supply.</p>

    <h2>Britain Turns to India</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Company expanded indigo cultivation in India.</li>
      <li>
        By <span>1810</span>, <span>95%</span> of Britain’s indigo came from
        India.
      </li>
      <li>Many Scotsmen and Englishmen came to India as planters.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How Was Indigo Cultivated?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Two main systems: nij and ryoti.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Nij Cultivation and Problems</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Planter directly produced indigo on his own land.</li>
      <li>
        Difficult to expand due to population and fertile land limitations.
      </li>
      <li>Needed many laborers and ploughs/bullocks.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      → Planters avoided expanding nij cultivation till late
      <span>19th century</span>.
    </p>

    <h2>Indigo on the Land of Ryots</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Under ryoti system, planters pressured headmen to sign contracts on
        behalf of ryots.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>→ Contract led to cash advances at low interest for producing indigo.</p>
    <p>→ Ryots had to grow indigo on <span>25%</span> of their land.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Cycle of loan and low price continued, leaving peasants trapped.</li>
      <li>Indigo exhausted soil and left it unfit for rice.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The “Blue Rebellion” and After</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        In <span>1859</span>, ryots rebelled with support of zamindars and
        headmen.
      </li>
      <li>
        Writers and intellectuals highlighted the misery of ryots and cruelty of
        planters.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>→ Indigo Commission was set up to investigate.</p>
    <p>→ Planters were found guilty for coercion.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Post-revolt, indigo production shifted to Bihar.</li>
      <li>
        In <span>1917</span>, Mahatma Gandhi launched the Champaran movement
        against indigo planters.
      </li>
    </ul>
