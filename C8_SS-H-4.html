    <h2>How Did Tribal Groups Live?</h2>

    <h3>Some were jhum cultivators</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <span>Jhum cultivation</span> is another name for shifting cultivation.
      </li>
      <li>
        The cultivators cut treetops to allow sunlight and burnt vegetation to
        clear land.
      </li>
      <li>They used ash, rich in potash, to fertilize the soil.</li>
      <li>Seeds were broadcast (scattered) instead of ploughed and sown.</li>
      <li>
        After harvest, fields were left fallow for years and they moved to a new
        area.
      </li>
      <li>
        Found mostly in <span>hilly and forested regions</span> of northeast and
        central India.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Some were hunters and gatherers</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <span>Khonds</span> of Orissa hunted animals and collected forest
        produce.
      </li>
      <li>
        Collected fruits, roots, oils from <span>sal and mahua</span> seeds.
      </li>
      <li>Used herbs for medicine and sold produce in local markets.</li>
      <li>
        Traded with <span>traders and moneylenders</span> for goods they didn’t
        produce.
      </li>
      <li>
        Traders sold goods at high prices; moneylenders charged high interest.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      → Tribals came to see <span>traders and moneylenders</span> as exploiters
      and outsiders.
    </p>

    <h3>Some herded animals</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Tribal groups like <span>Van Gujjars</span> (Punjab hills),
        <span>Labadis</span> (Andhra), <span>Gaddis</span> (Kulu), and
        <span>Bakarwals</span> (Kashmir) herded cattle, sheep, or goats.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Some took to settled cultivation</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Many tribals started <span>settling permanently</span> and using the
        plough before the 19th century.
      </li>
      <li>
        They gained rights over land; in <span>Munda society</span>, land
        belonged to the entire clan.
      </li>
      <li>
        Over time, some clan members became more powerful and became chiefs.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>British officials</span> considered settled cultivators like Gonds
        and Santhals as more civilised.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How Did Colonial Rule Affect Tribal Lives?</h2>

    <h3>What happened to tribal chiefs?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <span>Tribal chiefs</span> earlier had administrative and economic
        power.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      → Under British rule, they lost administrative powers and had to follow
      British laws.
    </p>
    <p>
      → They could keep land titles but had to discipline tribals for the
      British.
    </p>

    <h3>What happened to the shifting cultivators?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        British wanted tribals to become
        <span>settled peasant cultivators</span> to collect regular revenue.
      </li>
      <li>
        Introduced <span>land settlements</span> with measurement and revenue
        fixing.
      </li>
      <li>Declared some as landowners, others as tenants.</li>
      <li>
        Efforts to settle jhum cultivators failed due to poor soil and water
        conditions.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>→ After protests, British allowed jhum cultivation in some forests.</p>

    <h2>Forest laws and their impact</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <span>Reserved Forests</span> were created for timber supply to the
        British.
      </li>
      <li>
        Tribals were banned from moving freely, collecting food, or hunting in
        these forests.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>→ Shifting cultivators had to migrate for livelihood.</p>
    <p>→ British lacked labour to cut and transport timber.</p>
    <p>
      → They gave small land patches in forests on condition of labour for the
      Forest Department.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Rebellions broke out like <span>Songram Sangma’s revolt</span> (1906) in
        Assam and <span>forest satyagraha</span> in 1930s Central Provinces.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>The problem with trade</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <span>Traders and moneylenders</span> entered forests during 19th
        century.
      </li>
      <li>
        In <span>Hazaribagh</span>, Santhals reared cocoons and sold them
        cheaply to agents.
      </li>
      <li>Agents sold them in Gaya at 5x profit; tribals got very little.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>The search for work</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Tribals migrated far from home for work in
        <span>tea plantations (Assam)</span> and
        <span>coal mines (Jharkhand)</span>.
      </li>
      <li>Received <span>low wages</span> and had poor living conditions.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>A Closer Look</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Tribals protested colonial laws, taxes, and exploitation throughout 19th
        and 20th centuries.
      </li>
      <li><span>Kols</span> rebelled in 1831–32.</li>
      <li><span>Santhals</span> revolted in 1855.</li>
      <li><span>Bastar Rebellion</span> occurred in 1910.</li>
      <li><span>Warli Revolt</span> happened in 1940.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Birsa Munda</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <span>Birsa</span> was born in the 1870s, grew up in forests of Bohonda,
        Jharkhand.
      </li>
      <li>Played flute, danced, and grazed sheep.</li>
      <li>Led a <span>reform movement</span> to purify Munda society.</li>
      <li>
        Urged people to stop drinking, clean villages, and stop believing in
        witchcraft.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      → In 1895, he inspired people to reclaim their past and set up
      <span>Munda Raj</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
      → He opposed missionaries, moneylenders, Hindu landlords, and the British
      government.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Arrested in 1895 and jailed for 2 years.</li>
      <li>
        On release, he gained support, attacked police stations, churches, and
        raised the <span>white flag</span> of Birsa Raj.
      </li>
      <li>Died of cholera in 1900; the movement faded.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      → The movement led to laws protecting <span>tribal land rights</span> from
      outsiders (dikus).
    </p>
    <p>
      → It showed that tribals could <span>organise and resist injustice</span>.
