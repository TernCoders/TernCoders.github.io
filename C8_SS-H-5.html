power</h3><ul><li>Since the mid-eighteenth century, <span>nawabs and rajas gradually lost their authority and honour</span>.</li><li>Residents were stationed in their courts, reducing their freedom.</li><li>Their <span>armed forces were disbanded</span>, and revenues and territories were taken away step by step.</li><li>Many ruling families <span>tried to negotiate</span> with the Company, but were ignored.</li><li>In <span>1801</span>, a <span>subsidiary alliance</span> was imposed on Awadh.</li><li>In <span>1856</span>, Awadh was taken over to ensure "proper administration".</li><li>In 1856, Governor-General Canning decided that <span>Bahadur Shah Zafar would be the last Mughal emperor</span>.</li></ul><h3>The peasants and the sepoys</h3><ul><li><span>Peasants and zamindars</span> were angry due to high taxes and harsh revenue collection methods.</li><li>Many peasants <span>lost their lands</span> after failing to repay loans to moneylenders.</li><li><span>Indian sepoys</span> were unhappy with pay, allowances, and service conditions.</li></ul><p>→ New rules hurt their religious beliefs, like crossing the sea meaning loss of caste and religion.</p><p>→ Sepoys were influenced by peasants’ anger and grievances.</p><h3>Responses to reforms</h3><ul><li><span>Laws were passed</span> to abolish sati and allow widow remarriage.</li><li><span>English-language education</span> was promoted.</li><li><span>Christian missionaries</span> were allowed to function freely and own property.</li><li>In <span>1850</span>, a

use cartridges suspected to be greased with <span>cow and pig fat</span>.</li><li>On <span>9 May</span>, 85 sepoys were jailed for 10 years for disobedience.</li><li>On <span>10 May</span>, soldiers freed their comrades, killed British officers, and declared war on the British.</li><li>On <span>11 May</span>, Meerut sepoys reached <span>Delhi</span> and were joined by the local regiments.</li></ul><p>→ They entered the Red Fort and declared <span>Bahadur Shah Zafar</span> their leader.</p><p>→ Zafar accepted and wrote to all rulers to form a confederacy to fight the British.</p><h3>The rebellion spreads</h3><ul><li>Regiments from various regions mutinied and joined forces in places like <span>Delhi, Kanpur, and Lucknow</span>.</li><li><span>People from villages and towns</span> joined, led by zamindars and local leaders.</li></ul><p>→ Key leaders included:</p><ul><li><span>Nana Saheb</span> in Kanpur</li><li><span>Birjis Qadr</span> in Lucknow</li><li><span>Rani Lakshmibai</span> in Jhansi</li><li><span>Kunwar Singh</span> in Bihar</li><li><span>Bakht Khan</span> in Bareilly</li></ul><p>→ The rebels <span>defeated British forces</span> in several places.</p><h3>The Company Fights Back</h3><ul><li><span>British reinforcements</span> arrived from England.</li><li>New laws made it easier to punish rebels.</li><li>British forces reoccupied storm centres one by one.</li></ul><p>→ In <span>September 1857</span>, Delhi was recaptured.</p><p>→ <span>Bahadur Shah Zafar</span> was tried and sent to <span>Rangoon</span> with his wife Zinat Mahal in October 1858.</p><p>→ He died in prison in <span>November 1862</span>.</p><p>→ <span>Lucknow</span> was taken in <span>March 1858</span>.</p><p>→ <span>Rani Lakshmibai</span> was killed in <span>June 1858</span>.</p><p>→ <span>Tantia Tope</span> was captured and executed in <span>April 1859</span>.</p><ul><li>To win loyalty, the British <span>rewarded loyal landholders</span> with rights over their land.</li><li>Hundreds of rebels and leaders were <span>tried and executed</span>.</li></ul><h2>Aftermath</h2><ul><li>By end of <span>1859</span>, British control over India was restored.</li><li><span>Government of India Act 1858</span> transferred power from the East India Company to the British Crown.</li></ul><p>→ A <span>Secretary of State</span> in British Cabinet was appointed for Indian governance.</p><ul><li><span>Ruling chiefs</span> were promised no more annexation and allowed to pass kingdoms to heirs (even adopted sons).</li><li>Indian rulers remained subordinates to the British Crown.</li><li><span>Indian soldiers</span> in the army were reduced; European soldiers increased.</li><li><span>Muslims’ property</span> was widely
