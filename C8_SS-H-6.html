    </a>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          The <span>British in India</span> wanted not only territorial conquest
          and control over revenues but also felt that they had a
          <span>cultural mission</span> and had to "<span
            >civilise the natives</span
          >", change their customs and values.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How the British saw Education</h2>

    <h3>The tradition of Orientalism</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          In 1783, <span>William Jones</span> arrived in Calcutta who was a
          linguist.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          → He had studied Greek and Latin at Oxford, knew French and English,
          Arabic and Persian.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          → At Calcutta, he started learning Sanskrit language, grammar and
          poetry.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          → Soon he was studying ancient Indian texts on law, philosophy,
          religion, politics, morality, arithmetic, medicine and other sciences.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Englishmen like <span>Henry Thomas Colebrooke</span> and
          <span>Nathaniel Halhed</span> were also busy discovering the ancient
          Indian heritage, mastering Indian languages and translating Sanskrit
          and Persian works into English.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          They set up the <span>Asiatic Society of Bengal</span> and started a
          journal called <span>Asiatick Researches</span>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          → They believed this project would help the British learn from Indian
          culture and also help Indians rediscover their heritage.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          → In this process, the British would become the guardians of Indian
          culture as well as its masters.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Many Company officials argued that the British ought to promote
          <span>Indian learning</span>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          They felt that institutions should be set up to teach
          <span>Sanskrit</span> and <span>Persian</span> literature and poetry.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          In 1781, a <span>madrasa</span> was set up in Calcutta to promote the
          study of Arabic, Persian and Islamic law.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          In 1791, the <span>Hindu College</span> was established in Benaras to
          encourage the study of ancient Sanskrit texts.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Not all officials shared these views and many criticised the
          Orientalists.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>“Grave errors of the East”</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          From the early nineteenth century, many British officials began to
          criticise the Orientalist vision of learning.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <span>James Mill</span> was one of those who declared that education
          should teach what is <span>useful and practical</span>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          → Indians should be made familiar with
          <span>scientific and technical advances</span> of the West.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          By the 1830s, <span>Thomas Babington Macaulay</span> saw India as an
          uncivilised country.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          → According to him, no Eastern knowledge could match what England had
          produced.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Macaulay stressed the importance of teaching the
          <span>English language</span>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          → Knowledge of English would expose Indians to world literature and
          Western science.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The <span>English Education Act of 1835</span> was introduced.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          → English was made the medium of instruction and Oriental institutions
          were defunded.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Education for commerce</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          In 1854, the <span>Wood’s Despatch</span> was sent by the Court of
          Directors of the East India Company.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          → It emphasised <span>practical benefits</span> of European learning
          over Oriental knowledge.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          → It would help Indians understand the importance of
          <span>trade, commerce</span>, and <span>resource development</span>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          → It would also improve the <span>moral character</span> of Indians.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li><p>Education departments were set up after the Despatch.</p></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What Happened to the Local Schools?</h2>

    <h3>The report of William Adam</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          In the 1830s, <span>William Adam</span> toured Bengal and Bihar to
          report on vernacular education.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          → He found over 1 lakh <span>pathshalas</span> with more than 20 lakh
          students.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          → These were set up by
          <span>local communities or wealthy individuals</span>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          → The system was <span>flexible</span> without fixed fees, books,
          buildings, or timetables.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          → Classes adjusted to <span>harvest times</span> and other local
          needs.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>New routines, new rules</h3>

      <li>
        <p>
          Till mid-nineteenth century, the Company focused mainly on
          <span>higher education</span>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          After 1854, it worked to <span>reform vernacular education</span>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li><p>→ Gurus had to follow timetables and submit reports.</p></li>
      <li><p>→ Textbooks, exams, and regular fees were introduced.</p></li>
      <li><p>→ Students had to follow discipline and fixed seating.</p></li>
      <li><p>→ Government grants supported pathshalas that complied.</p></li>
      <li>
        <p>
          → Poor rural children were most affected, as they couldn't attend
          regularly.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>→ Irregular attendance was seen as <span>lack of interest</span>.</p>
