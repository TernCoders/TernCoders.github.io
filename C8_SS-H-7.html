    <h1>When People Revolt</h1>

    <a href="C8_SS-H-7.pdf" class="book animated-link">
      <h2>See The Chapter PDF</h2>
    </a>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <h3>Early Years</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Before two hundred years, society was totally different.</li>
      <li>Most children were married off at an early age.</li>
      <li>Both Hindu and Muslim men could marry more than one wife.</li>
      <li>
        <span>'Sati Pratha'</span> (a widow burn herself on the funeral pyre of
        their husbands) was prevailing in Hindu society.
      </li>
      <li>Women’s rights to property were also restricted.</li>
      <li>Most women had virtually no access to education.</li>
      <li>
        In most regions, people were divided along lines of caste.
        <p>
          → <span>Brahmans and Kshatriyas</span> considered themselves as “upper
          castes”.
        </p>
        <p>
          → <span>Traders and moneylenders</span>, referred to as Vaishyas were
          placed after them.
        </p>
        <p>
          → <span>Peasants and artisans</span> such as weavers and potters
          referred to as Shudras were at the lowest rung.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        Over the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, many of these norms and
        perceptions slowly changed.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Working Towards Change</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        From the early nineteenth century, after the development of new forms of
        communication, debates and discussions about social customs and
        practices started.
      </li>
      <li>
        These debates were often initiated by Indian reformers and reform
        groups.
        <p>
          → <span>Raja Rammohun Roy</span> (1772-1833) was one such reformer who
          founded <span>Brahmo Sabha</span> in Calcutta.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        Reformers were those people who felt that changes were necessary in
        society, and unjust practices needed to be done away with.
      </li>
      <li>
        He was interested in spreading <span>Western education</span> and
        bringing about freedom and equality for women.
      </li>
      <li>
        He wrote about how women were confined to domestic work, not allowed to
        move out and become educated.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Changing the lives of widows</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Rammohun Roy campaigned against <span>sati</span>.</li>
      <li>In 1829, <span>sati</span> was banned.</li>
      <li>
        <span>Ishwarchandra Vidyasagar</span> suggested from ancient texts that
        widows could remarry, leading to the Widow Remarriage Act of 1856.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>Veerasalingam Pantulu</span> in Madras and
        <span>Swami Dayanand Saraswati</span> of Arya Samaj also supported widow
        remarriage.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Girls begin going to school</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Reformers like Vidyasagar and others set up
        <span>schools for girls</span>.
      </li>
      <li>
        People feared it would affect girls’ domestic duties and morality.
      </li>
      <li>Most girls were taught at home by liberal fathers or husbands.</li>
      <li>
        <span>Arya Samaj</span> in Punjab and <span>Jyotirao Phule</span> in
        Maharashtra established girls’ schools.
      </li>
      <li>
        Muslim girls learned the <span>Koran</span> at home, taught by women
        teachers.
        <p>
          → <span>Mumtaz Ali</span> reinterpreted Koran verses to support
          women’s education.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Women write about women</h3>

        <span>doctors and teachers</span>.

      <li>
        <span>Pandita Ramabai</span> wrote about upper-caste women’s lives and
        founded a <span>widows’ home</span>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Women wrote books, edited magazines, founded schools, and formed
        <span>political pressure groups</span> for suffrage and health rights.
